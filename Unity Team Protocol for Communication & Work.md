## Unity Team Protocol for Communication & Work

Welcome to Unity.<br/>

This document describes onboarding instructions, mediums of communication, and guidelines the project uses for collaborative work.<br/>

### Onboarding Instructions:<br/>
- Register for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/download).
- Register for [Trello](https://trello.com/unitymarketing2/recommend).
- Register for [GitHub](https://github.com/) (For developers and anyone making pull requests).
- Fill out the [onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJTi0BMuMaelZy_ZoGqi1wV_JUMbWya8II8PonQVQNm_9_wA/viewform).
- Fill out the [team section form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei1NtcP__KMBQ5ZCEe-AvPxrVjnz9ZCGHY5DW1zqc3PbEtIQ/viewform) to be added to the website (Optional).
- Inform your team leader you have completed onboarding instructions and ask for access to communication mediums.<br/>

### Mediums of Communication:<br/>
- Unity private Discord server is the primary text-based communication medium for real-time collaborative work. Each and every channel has specific purposes:<br/>
    1.  *#Important-notice* is exclusively for announcing important/time-sensitive work or emergencies. Do not mute this channel. Everyone should read notices as soon as possible. After work or emergency is resolved, an Emoji Reaction should be used on the notice. **Not for work chat or chit-chat.**
    2. *#Important-work* is exclusively for messages related to work on important tasks or emergencies. **Not for chit-chat, only important work.**
    3. *#General* is for chit-chat and less important/time-sensitive inter-team work. Use your own team channel for work that would not benefit from inter-team coordination.
    4. *#Development* is for development work.
    5. *#Marketing* is for marketing work.
    6. *#Support* is for support work.
    7. *#Updates* is for daily one-sentence updates and weekly essay or linked document updates from each team/task leader.
    8. Additional channels may be created as needed for new tasks or teams that would not benefit from sharing communication with existing channels.
    9. In Unity’s public Discord server, the private #Mentors channel is for working with certain contributors from the community.<br/>


- Trello is used to update teams on the status of tasks. Trello is comprised of a board (i.e. Unity Marketing), lists (i.e. In Progress), cards (i.e. Graphics Task #1), and tags (i.e. #High priority). Use the filter feature to search for relevant tags.<br/>
    1. A board should exist for Development, Marketing, Support, and any new teams or tasks distinct enough to have its own Discord channel.
    2. A list should exist for Todo, In Progress, In Review, and Finished.
    3. A card should exist for each task.
    4. Every card should be given a priority tag (#High, #Medium, or #Low).
    5. Card can optionally be given one or more username tag (#Veramis, #S3v3nh4cks) and/or job tag (#Content, #Design) for filtering cards.
    6. Cards can be given a deadline.
    7. If any task has issues and the deadline might not be met, note it in the card comments and inform your team in a timely manner.
    8. Cards should be moved to the correct status list as work progresses.<br/>


- (For development team members) GitHub is for collaborative development work, feature and pull requests, and file repository. Ask team leader if any questions.<br/>

### Guidelines:<br/>
- Try to follow the separation of communication as outlined in the last section. Discord is for real-time communication. Trello is for updating and being updated on tasks. GitHub is for developers and anyone making pull requests.
- Never grant anyone outside of Unity team access to the private Discord, Trello, GitHub, or resources, without explicit permission from your team leader.
- Do not disclose private Unity discussion or work-related information to the public or to any private channel in Unity public Discord server, unless you have obtained explicit permission from your team leader.
- Before any marketing material is released to the public, it must be vetted. Find the category of your material and follow its instructions for vetting.<br/>
    1. Graphics, Social Media Posts, and Articles: Must follow brand guide. Check with at least 1 designer and copywriter. If not absolutely certain about technical data, also check with at least 1 developer.
    2. Newsletter: Must follow newsletter guide. Check with at least 1 designer, 2 copywriters, and 2 developers.
    3. ETA and Emergency Announcements: Notify team in #Important-notice channel in Unity private Discord server. Await team leader instructions.
